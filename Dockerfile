# Create a new stage for running the application that contains the minimal
# runtime dependencies for the application. This often uses a different base
# image from the build stage where the necessary files are copied from the build
# stage.
#
# The example below uses an aspnet alpine image as the foundation for running the app.
# It will also use whatever happens to be the most recent version of that tag when you
# build your Dockerfile. If reproducability is important, consider using a more specific
# version (e.g., aspnet:7.0.10-alpine-3.18),
# or SHA (e.g., mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet@sha256:f3d99f54d504a21d38e4cc2f13ff47d67235efeeb85c109d3d1ff1808b38d034).
